                Call me <strong>"Maria".</strong> Typical name, but not a typical person.
                I am a fast-talking, fun-loving and adventure-seeking IT professional with a growing
                    passion for web design. I seek to translate my boundless energy into dynamic-yet-functional
                    contents that make browsing in websites a pleasurable experience. Just like how going to theme parks,
                    driving fast (without breaking the speed limit), partying at the beach and shopping sprees can make
                    people, especially me ðŸ˜‰...happy.
                    So I hope you enjoy exploring this new-born cyber crib. Feel free to drop some comments
                        or
                        suggestions. I will appreciate and use them as inspiration.

                        <h5 class="ty">Thank you!</h5>
